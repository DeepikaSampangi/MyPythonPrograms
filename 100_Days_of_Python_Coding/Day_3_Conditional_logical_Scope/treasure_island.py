# Instructions
# Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

# To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.

# However, I think the fun part is writing your own story 😊

# 🧞‍♂️ 🐊 🧙‍♂️ 🧟 🧚‍♂️ 🧝‍♂️ 🥷 🤖 👽 🙀

# That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

# Text Snippets from my example
# 'You\'re at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
# 'You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
# "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
# "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
# "You found the treasure! You Win!"
# "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
# "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
# "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
# "You fell into a hole. Game Over."
